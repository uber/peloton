// Describes a domain. A domain is a collection of hosts that have
// similar characteristics. Mesos currently only supports "fault
// domains", which identify groups of hosts with similar failure
// characteristics.
//
// Frameworks can generally assume that network links between hosts in
// the same fault domain have lower latency, higher bandwidth, and better
// availability than network links between hosts in different domains.
// Schedulers may prefer to place network-intensive workloads in the
// same domain, as this may improve performance. Conversely, a single
// failure that affects a host in a domain may be more likely to
// affect other hosts in the same domain; hence, schedulers may prefer
// to place workloads that require high availability in multiple
// domains. (For example, all the hosts in a single rack might lose
// power or network connectivity simultaneously.)
//
// There are two kinds of fault domains: regions and zones. Regions
// offer the highest degree of fault isolation, but network latency
// between regions is typically high (typically >50 ms). Zones offer a
// modest degree of fault isolation along with reasonably low network
// latency (typically <10 ms).
//
// The mapping from fault domains to physical infrastructure is up to
// the operator to configure. In cloud environments, regions and zones
// can be mapped to the "region" and "availability zone" concepts
// exposed by most cloud providers, respectively. In on-premise
// deployments, regions and zones can be mapped to data centers and
// racks, respectively.
//
// Both masters and agents can be configured with domains. Frameworks
// can compare the domains of two hosts to determine if the hosts are
// in the same zone, in different zones in the same region, or in
// different regions. Note that all masters in a given Mesos cluster
// must be in the same region.
